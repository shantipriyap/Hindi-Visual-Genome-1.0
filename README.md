# Hindi-Visual-Genome-1.0

Hindi Visual Genome 1.0, a multimodal dataset consisting of text and images suitable for English-to-Hindi multimodal machine translation task and multimodal research. We have selected short English segments (captions) from Visual Genome along with associated images and automatically translated them to Hindi with manual post-editing, taking the associated images into account. The training set contains 29K segments. Further 1K and 1.6K segments are provided in a development and test sets, respectively, which follow the same (random) sampling from the original Hindi Visual Genome. Additionally, a challenge test set of 1400 segments will be released for the WAT2019 multi-modal task. This challenge test set was created by searching for (particularly) ambiguous English words based on the embedding similarity and manually selecting those where the image helps to resolve the ambiguity.
